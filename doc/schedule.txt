Dartling Schedule

To do in Magic Boxes

open model shows twin relationships as one line

To do

to json, print, copy, paste, from json: Invalid esacape sequence in string literal
to json -> from json: no exception

entity code cannot be updated
what happens with the id entity map in entities when entity id is updated?

Duration (time span) type
add advanced model patterns to CategoryQuestion.Link model:
category tests
  reflexive relationship
  derived path (update json transfer)
member following tests
  twin relationships
