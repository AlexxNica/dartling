dartling To Do

debug the travel_impressions project
debug the dartling_dwt_todo_mvc_spirals project
debug the todo_mysql project on Windows
debug code generation for more complex models in the ModelConcepts/web/model
debug the use of mixin in ConceptGen classes

update 2 apps of dartling: category_links and travel_impressions (both with web components)

gen tests for composite ids where singleWhereId and not singleWhereAttributeId

include children in the setEntities integration (parents?)

add Latitude and Longitude data types, base: double

uuid
  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt
  https://github.com/Daegalus/dart-uuid

copy on entities produces entities that are not equal (is this correct?)

essentail for neighbors (true by default)
min (minimal properties only are shown in a web component) for properties ?

update does not have a corresponding Action class (cannot undo update)

unique model and concept names: DomainModel, DomainModelConcept ?

add abstract for boxes in Model Concepts
add all from Dartling to Model Concepts

action.doit when called directly by a user avoids a session doit
  ok when session is null for undoing the action
  not ok if session is not null
    how to make a distinction between a user call and a session past call?
