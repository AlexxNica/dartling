--------------------------------

Find: (get\s+[_a-zA-Z0-9]+)(\(\))(\s+(=>|\{))
Replace: $1$3

Make sure you have regex search on.
Works great in Sublime. 
I think the same syntax works in Textmate and likely other editors.

Nice results:

-------------------------------

we just removed the Math object from corelib in bleeding_edge. 
Use the dart:math library to get the same functionality. 
This change will likely break a lot of code. 
The easy fix is usually to put in #import('dart:math', prefix: 'Math') 
where the Math object was used. 
This will not work for calls to Math.random() though.
