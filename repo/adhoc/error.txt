I copy an entity and obtain a different entity object. 
When I compare entity attributes, they are all equal. 
When I compare ids of the two entities they are not equal:

  expect(marketing.id, isNotNull); // pass
  expect(afterUpdateMarketing.id, isNotNull); // pass   
  expect(marketing.id, equals(afterUpdateMarketing.id));  // does not pass !?

However, if I compare the ids directly by using the id equals method, they are equal:
      
  var idsEqual = false;
  if (marketing.id.equals(afterUpdateMarketing.id)) {
    idsEqual = true;
  }
  expect(idsEqual, isTrue); // pass
    
Finally, when I use ==, the ids are not equal:

  var idsEqual = false;
  if (marketing.id == afterUpdateMarketing.id) { 
    idsEqual = true;
  }
  expect(idsEqual, isTrue); // does not pass !?

I have a strange situation in the Dart code of the Dartling project at  
https://github.com/dzenanr/Dartling .

In my local development folder of Dartling there are no errors. 
I have done the git push for the latest version.

When I git clone the Dartling project in a different folder and open the folder 
with the same Dart Editor I get an error:

'file:///C:/Users/ridjanod/git/test/Dartling/repository/domain/model/event/actions.dart': 
Error: line 28 pos 16: class 'Action' is already defined
abstract class Action implements ActionApi {
               ^
'file:///C:/Users/ridjanod/git/test/Dartling/Dartling.dart': 
Error: line 76 pos 1: library handler failed
#source('repository/domain/model/event/actions.dart');
^

This error does not exist in the development folder.

I do not have any idea what could go wrong. 
Please help me so that other people can use Dartling without errors.

Hi Dzenan,

I just cloned your repo, and the only errors I see are from the unittest library 
not found. I added a pubspec.yaml file to get the unittest library. 
(Be sure to set the editor's package directory in preferences to your 
project's packages directory. note: this will be easier soon)

Once I had it all plugged in and working, I started to see errors like 
"no such type Entities" in meta/Attributes.dart.

Here's the weird thing: all I had to do to silence the errors was make an empty 
change to dartling.dart and save it. Then the errors went away. I'll file a bug.  
http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=4612

Not sure if we solved your problem, but glad we had the chance to identity a new 
bug to fix.

I've occasionally seen issues in one of my larger projects in which randomly 
the Analyzer seems to 'lose' a file/class. I need to right-click on the file 
containing the class and hit stop analyzing, then re-start it again and the 
errors disappear.

I have not been able to successfully reproduce the issue at will so had not 
filed a bug report.

-----------------------

I have made an empty change and even used do not analyze for the actions.dart 
file, but I still get an error that cannot be since the Action is defined only 
once in the whole project (there are no other Action classes in the whole 
project):

'file:///C:/Users/ridjanod/git/test/dartling/repository/domain/model/event/actions.dart': 
Error: line 28 pos 16: class 'Action' is already defined
abstract class Action implements ActionApi {
               ^
'file:///C:/Users/ridjanod/git/test/dartling/dartling.dart': 
Error: line 80 pos 1: library handler failed
#source('repository/domain/model/event/actions.dart');
^

Thus, if someone else clones my project, that person will think that the project 
is buggy, while I do not have errors in the latest version of Dartling.

Really strange.

-----------------------

Resolved with the new version of dart Editor.
