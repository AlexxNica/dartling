Dartling
========

Dartling is a Dart model framework. A model consists of concepts, concept attributes and concept neighbors (two neighbors make a relationship between two concepts). After a model is described by its concepts, concept attributes and concept neighbors, it might be used without any additional programming for quick prototypes.
