I copy an entity and obtain a different entity object. 
When I compare entity attributes, they are all equal. 
When I compare ids of the two entities they are not equal:

  expect(marketing.id, isNotNull); // pass
  expect(afterUpdateMarketing.id, isNotNull); // pass   
  expect(marketing.id, equals(afterUpdateMarketing.id));  // does not pass !?

However, if I compare the ids directly by using the id equals method, they are equal:
      
  var idsEqual = false;
  if (marketing.id.equals(afterUpdateMarketing.id)) {
    idsEqual = true;
  }
  expect(idsEqual, isTrue); // pass
    
Finally, when I use ==, the ids are not equal:

  var idsEqual = false;
  if (marketing.id == afterUpdateMarketing.id) { 
    idsEqual = true;
  }
  expect(idsEqual, isTrue); // does not pass !?

I have a strange situation in the Dart code of the Dartling project at  
https://github.com/dzenanr/Dartling .

In my local development folder of Dartling there are no errors. 
I have done the git push for the latest version.

When I git clone the Dartling project in a different folder and open the folder 
with the same Dart Editor I get an error:

'file:///C:/Users/ridjanod/git/test/Dartling/repository/domain/model/event/actions.dart': 
Error: line 28 pos 16: class 'Action' is already defined
abstract class Action implements ActionApi {
               ^
'file:///C:/Users/ridjanod/git/test/Dartling/Dartling.dart': 
Error: line 76 pos 1: library handler failed
#source('repository/domain/model/event/actions.dart');
^

This error does not exist in the development folder.

I do not have any idea what could go wrong. 
Please help me so that other people can use Dartling without errors.
